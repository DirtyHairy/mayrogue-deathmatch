/**
 * Change namespace. Provides the various actual changes and serialization /
 * deserialization.
 *
 * A change encapsulates an atomic change to the world state. Changes to the
 * world state on the server (and on the client) are repesented as change
 * instances, serialized and passed to the other side. There, they are
 * unserialized and applied.
 *
 * To this end, each change has an 'apply' method. The first parameter to this
 * method is the world state (an instance of world), the second a flag which is
 * set if the change should be considered 'stale'. A change is considered stale
 * if the server state lags behind the client state (i.e. not all actions
 * requested by the client have been processed).
 *
 * In order to determine whether a change is stale, each change is assigned an
 * unique, incrementing generation index. Each update published by the server
 * includes the generation of the last change processed; if it is smaller than
 * the last generation send by the client, the change is considered stale.
